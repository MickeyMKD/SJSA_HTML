    <p><b>Mass Effect</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_science_fiction" target=_blank>military
            science fiction</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_franchise" target=_blank>media
            franchise</a> created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Hudson" target=_blank>Casey
            Hudson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Karpyshyn" target=_blank>Drew Karpyshyn</a> and
        Preston Watamaniuk. The franchise depicts a distant future where humanity and several alien civilizations have
        colonized the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way" target=_blank>Milky Way</a> galaxy using
        technology left behind by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_race" target=_blank>advanced precursor
            civilization</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The franchise originated in a series of video games developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare"
            target=_blank>BioWare</a> and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts"
            target=_blank>Electronic Arts</a>. Each installment is a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_shooter" target=_blank>third-person shooter</a> with <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game" target=_blank>role-playing</a> elements. The first
        three games form a trilogy in which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character"
            target=_blank>player character</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Shepard"
            target=_blank>Commander Shepard</a>, attempts to save the galaxy from a race of ancient, hibernating
        machines known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reapers_(Mass_Effect)" target=_blank>Reapers</a>.
        The inaugural video game in the series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_(video_game)"
            target=_blank>Mass Effect</a> (2007), follows Shepard's investigation of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saren_Arterius" target=_blank>Saren Arterius</a>, one of the Reapers'
        agents. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_2" target=_blank>Mass Effect 2</a> (2010) begins two
        years later and sees Shepard's forces battling the Collectors, an alien race abducting human colonies to
        facilitate the Reapers' return. The original trilogy's final installment, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_3" target=_blank>Mass Effect 3</a> (2012), depicts a war
        between the Reapers and the rest of the galaxy. A fourth game, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda" target=_blank>Mass Effect: Andromeda</a> (2017),
        featured a new setting and cast of characters, with a fifth in active development.
        <br>
        <br>
        The original trilogy was met with commercial success as well as universal acclaim. Critics praised the game's
        narrative, characters, voice acting, world building, and emphasis on player choice. The ending of Mass Effect 3
        drew widespread criticism for being an unsatisfying conclusion to the trilogy, prompting Electronic Arts to
        release an expanded cut with additional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene"
            target=_blank>cutscenes</a>. Mass Effect: Andromeda received mixed reviews. Praise was directed at the
        game's visuals and combat, but criticized its technical issues and plot.

        The series has generated attention and discussion about its representation of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality" target=_blank>same-sex relationships</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_minority" target=_blank>sexual minorities</a>. It also originated
        the dialogue wheel, a mechanic similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_tree"
            target=_blank>dialogue trees</a>, enabling players to dynamically steer conversations by selecting from a
        number of preset choices; the feature has seen widespread use in other role-playing video games. The success of
        the video game series spawned an extended universe, including novels and comics.
